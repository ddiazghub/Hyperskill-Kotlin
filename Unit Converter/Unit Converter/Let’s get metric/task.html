<p>The examples you've printed are great, but they are not really helpful. Let's take a step further and create a program that converts kilometers to meters. Remember that one kilometer equals exactly 1000 meters.</p>
<p>The program should prompt the user to enter the number of kilometers with the following message: <code class="java">"Enter a number and a measure: "</code>. The user should input a number and a unit of measurement, for example, <code class="java">2 km</code> or <code class="java">2 kilometers</code>. Note that the units of measurement should be case insensitive, so "km", "KM", and "kM" should work just as fine as "km". </p>
<p>The program should then output the equivalent of x kilometers in meters in the following format: <code class="java">x kilometers is y meters</code>.</p>
<p>If the name of the unit of measurement is entered incorrectly, the program should display: <code class="java">Wrong input</code>.</p>
<h5 id="objectives" style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h5>
<ol>
<li>The program should convert the given number of kilometers to meters.</li>
<li>The user can input "km", "kilometer" or "kilometers".</li>
<li>The program should ask the user for input only once, not infinitely.</li>
<li>If the value is 1, the name of the unit must be singular, otherwise, plural: "1 kilometer" but "2 kilometers".</li>
<li>It is guaranteed that the number of kilometers is an integer.</li>
<li>If the name of the unit of measurement is entered incorrectly, the program should display: <code class="java">Wrong input</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="java">Enter a number and a measure: 25 km
25 kilometers is 25000 meters</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="java">Enter a number and a measure: 1 kiLOmeter
1 kilometer is 1000 meters
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="java">Enter a number and a measure: 5 miles
Wrong input
