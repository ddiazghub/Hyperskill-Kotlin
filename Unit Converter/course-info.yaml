language: English
summary: "<p>When you travel, everything changes: people, languages, time zones, and\
  \ even units. It may be difficult to read the temperature in Fahrenheit when you’\
  ve always used Celsius, or to measure yourself in kilos if you’ve only used pounds.\
  \ It’s no easy matter, though a nice unit converter could certainly help! In this\
  \ project, you will write a converter that handles distance, weight, and temperature\
  \ units – all the traveller’s essentials.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href=\"\
