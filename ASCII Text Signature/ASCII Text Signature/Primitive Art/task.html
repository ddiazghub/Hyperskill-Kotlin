<p>An ASCII generator is an awesome program that can output any document, picture, or text file in 2-D using only text symbols. It is often used to print name tag badges for various conferences and meetings. In this project, you will write an ASCII generator that can print name tags.</p>
<p>Let's start with generating the simplest name tag with just a first name and a last name on it. Your task is to generate a tag for someone with the first name "Hyper" and the last name "Skill". You also need to create a frame around the text  as shown in the example.</p>
<h5 id="objectives" style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h5>
<p>Print the string “Hyper Skill” in a frame.</p>
<p>Your program should output the string “Hyper Skill” in a frame. Left and right borders are marked with the symbol <code class="java">'|'</code>, the top border is marked with <code class="java">'_'</code>, and the bottom border with <code class="java">'•'</code>.</p>
